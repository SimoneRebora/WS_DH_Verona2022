## Corpus

The corpus is based on the German ELTeC collection (v1.0.0, April 2021), available at https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ELTeC-deu (release DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4662482).  
All texts included in this collection are in the public domain. The original XML-TEI markup was removed to create plain text files. Only 65 of the original 100 texts were kept (excluding authors who contributed to the collection with just one text).
